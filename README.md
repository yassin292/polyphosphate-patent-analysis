- `scripts/`: R scripts for analysis and visualization
- `output/`: Exported plots and tables for figures

##  Dependencies

Run the R script with the following packages installed:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "RColorBrewer"))

## Contents

- `data/`: Raw and processed patent datasets
- `scripts/`: R scripts for cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- `output/`: Exported plots and tables for inclusion in review articles
